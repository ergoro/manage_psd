Productivity Measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One common method for measuring total factor productivity (TFP) relies on
 the econometric estimation of an aggregate production function.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another common method is the growth accounting approach introduced by Stigler
 (1947), Abramovitz (1956), and Kendrick (1956) and refined by Kendrik (1961)
 and Denison (1962, 1967, 1972, 1974).
 In this method, the elasticities of the inputs are typically calibrated
 to the national income shares.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This function relates outputs to inputs and a residual measure of efficiency.
 In this context, we measure productivity at the two digit level ISIC code
 in order to have less heterogeneity across outputs and inputs of different
 firms.
 In the database for Brazil, the sectors with the highest number of observations
 were textiles and furniture.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Textile and clothing corresponds to ISIC 18 (manufacture of wearing apparel;
 dressing and dyeing of fur) and furniture to ISIC 36 (manufacture of furniture;
 manufacturing n.e.c.).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In addition, the textiles sector was selected given its pivotal role in
 both providing employment for low skilled labor and creating dynamic effects
 that foster industrialization (Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007; Keane and te
 Velde, 2008).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this article, we calculated TFP using different methods: the stochastic
 frontier of Battese and Coelli (1988, 1992, STCH), the control function
 approach of Levinsohn and Petrin (2003, LP), and the corrected control
 function approach of Ackerberg et al.
 (2015, ACF)

 the estimation of TFP in a setting where technology is Hicks neutral, capital

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Stochastic Frontier Model of Battese and Coelli (1988, 1992, STCH) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically, several production functions assume producers to be successful
 optimizers.
 However, Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) highlighted that for producing an
 output, not all producers: use the minimum inputs under a given technology
 (technically efficient); allocate inputs in a cost-effective manner given
 input prices (cost efficient); or allocate their outputs in a revenue-maximizin
g manner given output prices (profit efficient).
 So, there are several instances where cost is not minimized or profit is
 not maximized.
 In stochastic frontier models, the analysis is conducted relaxing the successfu
l optimizers assumption and accounting the differences of firms that operate
 a at a production frontier (using inputs and outputs in the most efficient
 manner) and those firms that do not.
 In the frontier approach, error terms are composed of a traditional random
 noise component (as in various least squares techniques where errors terms
 are assumed to be symmetrically distributed with zero means) and a new
 one-sided inefficiency component that aims to capture the effects of inefficien
cy
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Thus, the composed error terms are not symmetric and do not have zero means
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The random variation in the operating environment generating inefficiencies
 that, in turn, create one-sided variations make the production frontiers
 stochastic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specific model is is an extension of Battese and Coelli (1988) that
 can be applied to panel data.
 Battese and Coelli (1992) defined the model as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{it}=f(x_{it};\beta)exp(V_{it}-U_{it})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{it}=\eta_{it}U_{i}=\left\{ exp[-\eta(t-T)]\right\} U_{i},\:\;t\text{∈}\zeta(i);i=1,2,...,N;
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}$
\end_inset

 is the production function for firm 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{it};\beta)$
\end_inset

 is an appropriate function with vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{it};\beta$
\end_inset

 of factor inputs and unknown parameters, respectively.
 The measurement and specification of random errors 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{it}$
\end_inset

 are assumed to be independently and identically distributed 
\begin_inset Formula $N(0,\sigma_{V}^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 While, one-sided inefficiencies 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{it}$
\end_inset

 are independent and identically distributed non-negative truncations of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 An unknown scalar parameter is represented by
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(i)$
\end_inset

 represents a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

time periods (out of a
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 total period) for which there are observations for a firm 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The STCH model is highly suitable for unbalanced panel datasets (Daude and
 Fernández-Arias, 2010; Ibarrarán, Maffioli and Stucchi, 2009).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Control Function Approach of Levinsohn and Petrin (2003, LP)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LP method is an extension of the method developed by Olley and Pakes
 (1996) originally aimed at avoiding potential serial correlations between
 input levels and unobserved (but, potentially observable or predictable)
 firm-specific processes that affect the production technology (in other
 words, factors or shocks hidden in the error term that might be affecting
 decisions about capital and labor and, thus, make the estimated parameters
 inconsistent).
 Olley and Pakes (1996) used investment as a variable that could reveal
 and control for these unobserved shocks, but investment: is not a variable
 easily found in firm level datasets (if found, several times is equal to
 zero); is prone to data quality problems; is likely, in turn, to be affected
 by unobservable shocks; and requires the analysis of a dynamic programming
 problem to verify the strict monotonicity assumption of investment as a
 function of marginal products of capital and productivity shocks.
 So, LP proposed a method that uses intermediate inputs instead of investment
 to account for the unobserved shocks.
 Intermediate inputs are proposed because: they are non-dynamic inputs (which
 makes it easier to satisfy the strict monotonicity assumption); they affect
 current profits and do not rule out shocks to the investment demand function
 (prices or other unobservables); and they are more commonly available in
 firm level datasets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Corrected Control Function Approach of Ackerberg et al.
 (2015, ACF)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neverheless, ACF suggested that the Olley and Pakes (1996) and LP methods
 suffer from functional dependence problems, particularly in their first
 stages, where the estimated coefficient of labor is correctly identified
 only under a few and specific instances (for instance, when shocks to the
 price of labor or output occur after levels of investment or intermediate
 inputs are defined, but before decisions about labor are made)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ACF mentioned that in practice, the functional dependence problem would
 not be literally observed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, ACF proposed a method that uses inverted demand functions conditiona
l on decisions about labor inputs avoiding the functional dependence problem
 and also relaxing other assumptions.
 Specifically, the ACF method allows exogenous, serially correlated, unobserved
 shocks to the price and/or amount of labor while also accommodating labor
 to have dynamic effects (such as hiring and firing costs).
 The basic procedure, described by Ackerberg, Caves and Frazer (2015), uses
 the following value added production function (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{it}$
\end_inset

 represent unobserved productivity shocks that are potentially observable
 or predictable and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{it}$
\end_inset

 represent shocks that are not observable):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{k}k_{it}+\beta_{l}l_{it}+\omega_{it}+\varepsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ACF requires a number of assumptions when intermediates inputs are used
 as a proxy for unobserved shocks.
 The first assumption is concerned with the timing of decisions about inputs
 and establishes the accumulation of capital under the function below (capital
 and investment are decided in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 while labor 
\begin_inset Formula $(l_{it})$
\end_inset

 can be decided in periods 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $t-b$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $0<b\leq1$
\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{it}=\kappa(k_{it-1},i_{it-1})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next assumptions are scalar unobservable and strict monotonicity (in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{it}$
\end_inset

) in the following intermediate input demand function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{it}=\widetilde{f_{t}}(k_{it},l_{it},\omega_{it})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently, the above function is inverted 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{it}=\widetilde{f}_{t}^{-1}(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it})$
\end_inset

 and introduced into the production function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{it}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{k}k_{it}+\beta_{l}l_{it}+\widetilde{f}_{t}^{-1}(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it})+\varepsilon_{it}=\widetilde{\Phi}_{t}(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it})+\varepsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, using semiparametric methods, the first stage moment condition is
 defined as follows (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\widetilde{\Phi}}_{t}(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it})$
\end_inset

 is estimated, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{l}$
\end_inset

 is not):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[\varepsilon_{it}\mid I_{it}\right]=E\left[y_{it}-\hat{\widetilde{\Phi}}_{t}(k_{it},l_{it},m_{it})\right]=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production function parameters (including 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{l}$
\end_inset

) are estimated in the second stage moment condition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[\xi_{it}+\varepsilon_{it}\mid I_{it-1}\right]=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[y_{it}-\beta_{0}-\beta_{k}k_{it}-\beta_{l}l_{it}-g\left(\hat{\widetilde{\Phi}}_{t-1}(k_{it-1},l_{it-1},m_{it-1})-\beta_{0}-\beta_{k}k_{it-1}-\beta_{l}l_{it-1}\right)\mid I_{it-1}\right]=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the second moment requires the estimation of one additional parameter
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{l}$
\end_inset

, besides 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{k}$
\end_inset

), one more unconditional moment needs to be defined:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
E\Biggl[\left(y_{it}-\beta_{0}-\beta_{k}k_{it}-\beta_{l}l_{it}-\rho\left(\hat{\widetilde{\Phi}}_{t-1}(k_{it-1},l_{it-1},m_{it-1})-\beta_{0}-\beta_{k}k_{it-1}-\beta_{l}l_{it-1}\right)\right)\\
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1\\
k_{it}\\
l_{it-1}\\
\hat{\widetilde{\Phi}}_{t-1}(k_{it-1},l_{it-1},m_{it-1})
\end{array}\right)\Biggl]=0
\end{multline*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, the ACF method accounts for shocks related to 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{it}$
\end_inset

 whereas LP allows only shocks to 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{it}$
\end_inset

 and OP does not account for any of those.
 In any case, we used four methods (OLS, STCH, LP and ACF) to calculate
 TFP and study the distribution dynamics.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data for this article comes from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys
 Project.
 This project is well known for collecting firm-level data across countries
 using a common methodology, standardized questionnaires and a stratified
 random sample that covers the non-agricultural economy of main cities and
 nearby business areas.
 In addition to adequately covering different cities, sectors and firm sizes,
 the dataset also provides a wide arrange of variables that allow the calculatio
n of firm performance indicators such as productivity.
 One limitation, however, is that the project only focuses on formal firms
 with more than 5 employees.
 Thus, considering that about 40 percent of the Brazilian economy is informal
 (Schneider et al., 2011), economy-wide generalizations should be taken with
 caution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using data for the years 2003 and 2009, a balanced panel dataset has been
 constructed for each sector.
 As expected, this construction implied a large reduction in the sample
 size.
 Only 48 observations in textiles sector and 62 observations in the furniture
 sector had the required variables to compute TFP in both years.
 After structuring the panel dataset, the data cleaning process included
 a post-estimation of outliers procedure for all main variables

Estimations were also conducted for the case of OLS and STCH considering
 the information available for each year (2003 and 2009) separately as well
 as including a year dummy variable.
 Results of the estimated coefficients proved to be robust to these modification
s and are not included for the sake of brevity.
 The methods of ACF and LP require at least two points in time (panel data)
 to be executed, so no further explorations were done.

.
 The differences in the results for the method of ACF (columns 4 and 8)
 could be explained because of: the strict use of balanced panel data to
 account for productivity shocks and the collection of data being limited
 to two periods of time (more periods of time could improve the approximation
 among methods).

: The coefficients were estimated using the balanced panel data (only firms
 with complete data for sales, capital, labor, intermediate inputs and electrici
ty for the years 2003 as well as 2009).
 For the textiles sector, 48 firms comply with this condition and 62 firms
 for the furniture sector.
 Regarding the acronyms of the table, OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares
 estimation; STCH stands for the stochastic frontier model of Battese and
 Coelli (1988, 1992); LP stands for the control function approach of Levinsohn
 and Petrin (2003); and ACF stands for the corrected control function approach
 of Ackerberg et al.
 (2015).

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that the estimated parameters in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prod function est"

\end_inset

 will, in some instances, produce negative values of productivity which,
 according to Fernández-Arias and Rodríguez-Apolinar (2016), are not uncommon
 to find in the LAC region.
 They also disproved a hypothesis about the existence of these negative
 values based on measurement errors in the factor of labor (quality of education
, specifically) and further showed that a possible bias in human capital
 accumulation will actually strengthen the productivity shortfall in the
 region.
 Using the results of the production function estimation, we calculated
 TFP and detailed summary statistics for these values are presented in Tables
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TFP sum stat textile"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TFP sum stat furniture"

\end_inset

.
 It can be observed that the OLS and STCH methods consistently report similar
 values.
 ACF and LP provide TFP values in a different order of magnitude but with
 consistency within the methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These summary statistics are informative but they have limitations at the
 moment of understanding the behavior of TFP.
 For example, central tendency indicators such as median values suggest
 the textiles sector is experiencing a productivity deterioration over time,
 independently of the method used to calculate TFP.
 However, mean values for the same sector suggest slight improvements overall.
 Meanwhile, both median and mean values suggest improvements of TFP over
 time for the furniture sector.

Notes
\shape default
: TFP values were calculated using the coefficients estimated for the balanced
 panel data (only firms with complete data for sales, capital, labor, intermedia
te inputs and electricity for the years 2003 as well as 2009).
 Variables in logarithms are represented by lowercase letters in the left
 side of the table.
 Regarding the acronyms of the table, OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares
 estimation; STCH stands for the stochastic frontier model of Battese and
 Coelli (1988, 1992); LP stands for the control function approach of Levinsohn
 and Petrin (2003); and ACF stands for the corrected control function approach
 of Ackerberg et al.
 (2015).
 Among the TFP summary statistics, Std.
 Dev.
 stands for standard deviation, IQR for interquartile range and CV for coefficie
nt of variation (the rest are self-explanatory).

: TFP values were calculated using the coefficients estimated for the balanced
 panel data (only firms with complete data for sales, capital, labor, intermedia
te inputs and electricity for the years 2003 as well as 2009).
 Variables in logarithms are represented by lowercase letters in the left
 side of the table.
 Regarding the acronyms of the table, OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares
 estimation; STCH stands for the stochastic frontier model of Battese and
 Coelli (1988, 1992); LP stands for the control function approach of Levinsohn
 and Petrin (2003); and ACF stands for the corrected control function approach
 of Ackerberg et al.
 (2015).
 Among the TFP summary statistics, Std.
 Dev.
 stands for standard deviation, IQR for interquartile range and CV for coefficie
nt of variation (the rest are self-explanatory).

 suggest that not only there is significant dispersion (large differences)
 in productivity within relatively narrowly defined sectors (textiles and
 furnitures) but also this dispersion appears to be increasing over time.
 Nevertheless, it would be informative to study the speed (growth rates
 and rates of change) at which the dispersion (divergence) is occurring
 and how this speed varies between the SD and CV indicators.
 In tables X and Y, we present results of growth rates and rates of change.

Notes
\shape default
: TFP values were calculated using the coefficients estimated for the balanced
 panel data (only firms with complete data for sales, capital, labor, intermedia
te inputs and electricity for the years 2003 as well as 2009).
 Variables in logarithms are represented by lowercase letters in the left
 side of the table.
 Regarding the acronyms of the table, OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares
 estimation; STCH stands for the stochastic frontier model of Battese and
 Coelli (1988, 1992); LP stands for the control function approach of Levinsohn
 and Petrin (2003); and ACF stands for the corrected control function approach
 of Ackerberg et al.
 (2015).
 Among the TFP summary statistics, Std.
 Dev.
 stands for standard deviation, IQR for interquartile range and CV for coefficie
nt of variation (the rest are self-explanatory).

Additional Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables here present results when the coefficients for capital and labor
 were estimated using all the information available for each sector (tables
 presented in the main text were estimated using only the balanced panel
 data: firms with information for all main variables in the years 2003 and
 2009).
 The balanced panel dataset is used in the main text because the study of
 distribution dynamics focuses solely on firms contained in it.
 Below, outputs for summary statistics, the production function estimation
 and detailed TFP summary statistics are reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary statistics suggest a substantial reduction in the number of observations
 for each sector in the second round of the survey.
 In addition, a large number of observations is lost because of missing
 data and firms that were not surveyed in both years.
 Equivalent tables in the main text are tables
